# HL-LHC-Scattering-Monte-Carlo
A MATLAB suite for simulations of protons incident on a screen within the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN, Geneva. Produces full particle tracks, secondary particles, and beam tube energy deposition information. Created as part of a 3rd Year Project to assess the feasibility of a weak-beam transverse profile monitor for the HL-LHC. The goal of the simulation is to produce a distribution of the energy deposition in the HL-LHC superconducting magnets that results from the scattered protons and unshielded ionised electrons. This was used to determine material choice and geometry for a scintillator/transition radiaiton monitor to be placed in the primary proton halo.

To run a basic simulation, run the main.m file. The number of samples, beam sigma/offset and the screen geometry can be altered easily by changing values in the simulation setup. This script will automatically run most of the data visualisaiton methods once the simulation is complete. To avoid producing many figures and performing intensive data analysis, these lines can be commented out to suit your needs. The intormation from the simulation is stored in an instance of "MCResult". Available methods of obtaining the simulation data and visualising it can be found by typing "help MCResult" in the console, or viewing the code documentation.
